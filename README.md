Selenium Page Object Generator
==============================

A nimble and flexible [Selenium Page Object Model](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects) generator to improve [agile testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_testing) [process velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_(software_development)).

Selenium Page Object Generator is an essential tool to improve your workflow. It will generate [Page Object Model](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html) on active [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) or [Opera](http://www.opera.com/) tab with a single click, provided that all of the options and template are configured. The generated Page Object Model will be saved to pre-configured Chrome or Opera download folder.

The template is using [Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com/) expression, a clean logic-less semantic templating language.

This is an early BETA release, it expected to have rough edges, and limited functionality. It currently support 3 different targets: [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)), [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)), and [Robot Framework](http://robotframework.org/).

Installation
-
To install the newest released version on Chrome browser, please download it from [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/epgmnmcjdhapiojbohkkemlfkegmbebb).
To install the newest released version on Opera browser, please download it from [Opera addons catalog](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/selenium-page-object-generator).

Development Dependencies
-
You will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) as a local development dependency. The `npm` package manager comes bundled with all recent releases of `Node.js`.

`npm install` will attempt to resolve any `npm` module dependencies that have been declared in the projectâ€™s `package.json` file, installing them into the `node_modules` folder.

```bash
$ npm install
```

Development
-
To build the sources into corresponding packages, run:

```bash
$ gulp
```

The `/build` folder and `/dist` folder are created. All built files are placed in the `build` folder, and the distribution ready packages are placed in `dist` folder.

Distribution
-
Once the changes are in-place and ready for distribution, update `package.json` with new version, and run:

```bash
$ gulp
```

The `/dist` folder will contain distribution ready packages.
